# Welcome!
This is my portfolio! It was made in HTML5 and CSS3, and uses JavaScript and JSON for building. This project is built with Gulp with the following plugins: gulp-htmlmin, gulp-cssnano, gulp-sourcemaps, and gulp-autoprefixer.

## Dear Recruiters
The ./src directory is where you can find the unminifed source code.
